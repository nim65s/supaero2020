The following dependencies are needed:

- for using the pendulum models, you need Pinocchio and Gepetto-viewer. To be install using APT on Ubuntu 16.04 / 18.04 or follow https://stack-of-tasks.github.io/pinocchio/download.html.

- for using the neural networks in deeptable and qlearn, you need TensorFlow and TFLearn. To be installed through pip3. Follow https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip (although I do not recommend to use the virtualenv if you are not afraid to pollute your machine.

- for using Cozmo, install the Cozmo SDK through pip3. Follow http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/install-linux.html.

- for using Pyomo, install Anaconda3 (woooaah it's big!), and then install pyomo, pyomo.extras and ipopt from Conda. Follow: http://www.pyomo.org/installation

All the necessary steps are gathered in the install.sh script. Just run it and you should be good.
